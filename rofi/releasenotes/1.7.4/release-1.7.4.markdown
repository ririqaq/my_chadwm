# 1.7.4: Preshellected Optimizations

Another maintenance and small features expansion release. A lot of small
annoyances have been fixed and ignored errors are now more visually flagged to
the user. In the past typos in the theme could result into broken themes
without any warning to the user (except in debug mode), if an unknown link is
found it will now throw an error. To help the user find the right
documentation, the manpages are further split up into sub-pages and are
expanded

We now have:

* rofi(1)
* rofi-theme-selector(1)
* rofi-keys(5)
* rofi-theme(5)
* rofi-debugging(5)
* rofi-dmenu(5)
* rofi-script(5)

Another improvement made that can have huge impact on the user-experience is a
significant speedup in the async input reading of dmenu. It turned out glib's
GInputStream async methods are very slow. On large input sets where it was
supposed to improve the user experience, it made it unusable. To resolve this a
custom implementation has been made. Background loading is now close to the
same speed as loading at start before displaying. A million item list is now
near instant. On very large lists, the instant filtering automatically changes
to be postponed until the user stops typing. This severely reduces system load
and interface blocking.

A few long standing feature requests and bug reports have been implemented or fixed:

* Listview flow. You can now change the flow in the listview from vertical first
  to horizontal first. Making it mimic tables.

```bash
for i in {1..90}; do echo $i; done | rofi -dmenu -no-config -theme-str 'listview { columns: 3; flow: vertical; }'
```
![Vertical](./vertical.png)

```bash
for i in {1..90}; do echo $i; done | rofi -dmenu -no-config -theme-str 'listview { columns: 3; flow: horizontal; }'
```
![Horizontal](./horizontal.png)

* You can set a custom fallback icon for each mode.

```css
configuration {
  run,drun {
    fallback-icon: "application-x-addon";
  }
}
```

* In dmenu mode (and script) you can now make (some) changes to the theme, for
  example modifying the background color of the entry box.

```bash
echo -en "\0theme\x1felement-text { background-color: red;}\n"
```

* User scripts (for script mode) into `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rofi/scripts` directory
  are automatically available in rofi.

```bash
rofi -h
<snip>
Detected user scripts:
        â€¢ hc (/home/qball/.config/rofi/scripts/hc.sh)
</snip>
```

This script can now by shows by running `rofi -show hc`.

* You can now render text as icons, this allows you to use glyphs icon fonts as
  icons.

```bash
echo -en "testing\0icon\x1f<span color='green'>Test</span>" | rofi -dmenu
```

* Hide listview when unfiltered. (#1079) 

```css
listview {
    require-input: true;
}
```

* You can now add a separate icon or textbox widget to the UI that displays the
  current selected item. As an example see the included `sidebar-v2`.

* A bug was fixed that caused problems with newer xkeyboard-config versions and
  different keyboard layouts.
